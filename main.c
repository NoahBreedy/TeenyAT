 * This brief program is meant to serve as an ultra simplistic example of
 * how the TeenyAT header and source can be quickly used to create a
 * simulated system.  In this case, the system loads whatever binary image
 * is provided and runs it for up 123456 cycles.  Any attempt to read from
 * the bus will result in a 9-cycle access to the number 42, and writes to
 * the bus will have no side effect other than wasting 7 cycles.
