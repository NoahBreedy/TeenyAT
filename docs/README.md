## Introduction
This document provides a complete overview of the syntax, instructions, and usage of  **TeenyAT Assembly** for our virtual embedded microcontroller.

---

## Syntax Overview
Each instruction follows a standard format:

- **OPCODE**: The operation to be performed.  
- **OPERANDS**: Registers, immediate values, or memory addresses.  
- Most instructions are able to be written in the style of:

    `opcode register, immediate` <br>  
    `opcode register, register` <br>  
    `opcode register, register + immediate`

###### note: certain instructions do not follow this format see [`STR`](./instructions/str.md)

### Opcodes
###### note: value could be either a register or an immediate

### Pseudo Instructions
- These have no physical opcode but are instead synthesized using other ones  
  ###### note: Try to figure out how if you want a practice challenge :)
